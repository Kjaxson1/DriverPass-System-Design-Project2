# DriverPass-System-Design-Project2
System Design Document for the DriverPass project. Includes system modeling diagrams and technical requirements created for CS 255 portfolio submission.
Project Summary
The DriverPass project was developed for a client offering online driver's education and behind-the-wheel driving lessons. The client needed a system that would allow students to register, schedule lessons, track progress, and manage payments, while providing tools for administrators and instructors to efficiently manage operations. The System Design Document includes use case diagrams, activity diagrams, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, and technical requirements to model the system based on the client's needs.

Reflection
What did you do particularly well?
I did particularly well translating the client’s requirements into visual UML diagrams that clearly show how the system should function. I focused on making the diagrams detailed yet easy to understand.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would improve the activity diagrams by adding even more steps to show alternate flows and exception handling for better coverage of user actions.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I focused closely on the interview details and user pain points to ensure the system would offer a smooth registration and scheduling experience. Considering user needs is essential because it directly impacts how usable and successful the final system will be.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach designing software by starting with requirement analysis, followed by visual modeling through UML diagrams. In the future, I would incorporate feedback loops earlier, such as user testing of early models or wireframes, to catch improvements sooner.
